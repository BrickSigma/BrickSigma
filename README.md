My name is Junaid Chaudhry. I enjoy exploring different libraries and programming techniques, along with combining them with hardware like the Raspberry Pi and LEGO Mindstorms EV3 and building video games.

- A stereo system display for Windows desktop
- Asteroids clone
- Chroma-Key software (still in development)
- Tic-Tac-Toe AI with a graphic user interface

## What I'm currently working on
- A sockets library designed for video game programming

## Programming languages I use
- Python (for two and a half years)
- C (for the past six months)
